# About

Hi there, I’m Arindam, and this is my website.  

A little bit about me: I am a heterodox economist, working in the urban sector, specifically developing analytical frameworks to understand different forms of spatial inequalities within cities. Having worked for close to two decades as a researcher across policy and academic circles, I recently buckled down, and worked through a PhD. Now (insert eyeroll) I’m back to working as a researcher across policy and academic circles (perhaps tending slightly more one way than the other).   

My current research intersects three areas, and connects them back to my broader interest in spatial inequalities. First, I am studying the mechanics of wealth accumulation, particularly at the top of the wealth distribution. For this I am developing a set of simulation models that can allow one to test the impact that fiscal policies can have on the wealthy. The connect from this theme back to spatial inequalities in cities is through the dynamics of realised gains in housing assets—the primary asset type for close to 90 percent of the population.   

Second, I am studying the impact of (macro-)economic transitions (e.g., low carbon pathways) on the morphology of urban regions. At the moment this research is in an exploratory phase, but indications of initial results suggest that the evolution of spatial distributions of labour and firms in a city region are often misaligned, which can have disproportionate impacts on aggregate spatial inequality, especially in city regions with strained infrastructures and services.  

Third, is a meta theme: investigating the critical role of data ecosystems in spatial decision-making in cities, specifically looking at how data deficits can hinder such processes, and whether more data is sub-optimal.  

My current CV is available [here](https://1drv.ms/b/c/f5547308254bd5c8/IQD5F9yMNAZ9SaGmayHp8OH0AabrvAQzV0flK62uvOLv90Q?e=yZmHkf).

I also try to have a life outside of work, even though the last few years of PhD-ing and CapeTown-ing have taken a toll on these endeavours. Most notably, I love quizzing (used to host a regular drinks+quiz event back in Bangalore), am a certified carpenter (without his tools at the moment), and enjoy running chemistry experiments in the kitchen (only started understanding organic chemistry when I started cooking—hated it in school).

As this website is populated, the portfolio page will have a link to my publications and other media that I produce. The shares page will mostly become a repository of data and visualisations—it is likely that this will be least updated page on this site. I intend to keep the blog active this time round, hopefully updating at least twice a month.
